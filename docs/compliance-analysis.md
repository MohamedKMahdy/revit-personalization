## Detailed Clause-by-Clause Analysis

### Clause 1 — API Event Subscription
> *"A native C# Revit add-in will subscribe to relevant API events (e.g., DocumentChanged and element-level events) to capture modeling actions."*

**Status: ✅ Fully compliant**

`App.cs` subscribes to:
- `ControlledApplication.DocumentChanged` — the primary event, fires once per committed transaction
- `DocumentOpened` / `DocumentCreated` — to start a session
- `DocumentClosing` — to flush and seal the session file

`ActionCapture.ProcessEvent()` is called for every `DocumentChangedEventArgs` and processes `GetAddedElementIds()` and `GetModifiedElementIds()` — the two element-level change sets.

---

### Clause 2 — Noise Filtering
> *"Filter out view navigation and non-authoring events, focusing on element placement, parameter modifications, and tagging operations characteristic of Custom Element Instantiation loops."*

**Status: ✅ Fully compliant**

Two layers of filtering are applied:

**Layer 1 — Action type filter** (`ActionCapture.HandleAdded` / `HandleModified`):
- Only `FamilyInstance` elements in the `AuthoringCategories` set trigger Place/SetParam records
- Only `IndependentTag` elements trigger Tag records
- Tag records are emitted **only on add** — modifications (leader repositioning) are explicitly suppressed

**Layer 2 — Parameter filter** (`ElementSnapshot.ShouldTrack`):
- Read-only parameters excluded
- Auto-computed parameters excluded (Area, Volume, Perimeter)
- Revit-managed metadata excluded (Phase Created, Workset, Design Option)
- Non-primitive storage types excluded (ElementId, None)

View navigation, selection changes, view creation, and annotation moves do not trigger `DocumentChanged` at the level we subscribe to, so they are implicitly filtered.

---

### Clause 3 — Semantic Action Abstraction
> *"Abstract low-level event data into structured, semantic actions such as Place(FamilyType), SetParam(ElementId, Name, Value), and Tag(ElementId, TagFamily), stored as JSON sequences."*

**Status: ✅ Fully compliant — and enriched beyond the minimum requirement**

The thesis requires three action types with these minimum fields:

| Thesis spec | Our implementation | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| `Place(FamilyType)` | `action_type:"Place"` + `family_name` + `type_name` | We capture both family and type separately, which is more precise than a single `FamilyType` string |
| `SetParam(ElementId, Name, Value)` | `action_type:"SetParam"` + `element_id` + `param_name` + `param_value_after` | We also capture `param_value_before` and `param_storage_type` |
| `Tag(ElementId, TagFamily)` | `action_type:"Tag"` + `tagged_element_id` + `tag_family_name` | `tagged_element_id` links the tag to its target element for episode grouping |

All records are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) — one JSON object per line — which is a superset of "JSON sequences".

---

### Clause 4 — Jang & Lee (2023) Schema Compliance
> *Jang & Lee (2023) arXiv:2305.18032: "Improving BIM authoring process reproducibility with enhanced BIM logging"*
> *Jang et al. (2023) AEI 57, 102079: "Lexicon-based content analysis of BIM logs for diverse BIM log mining use cases"*

**Status: ✅ Above requirement — directly implements both papers' schema proposals**

| Jang & Lee (2023) requirement | Our field | Value example |
|-------------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| `transaction_id` — groups all records from one atomic Revit transaction | `transaction_id` | `"1e9d18e5f8c6"` |
| `transaction_name` — undo-stack label for semantic intent | `transaction_name` | `"Door"`, `"Modify element attributes"` |
| `param_value_before` — state before the transaction | `param_value_before` | `"3C09"` |
| `param_value_after` — state after the transaction | `param_value_after` | `"DD1"` |
| Rich spatial context | `level_name`, `view_id`, `view_name`, `view_type` | `"L1 - Block 35"`, `"FloorPlan"` |
| Temporal project context | `phase_name` | `"New Construction"` |

| Jang et al. (2023) AEI lexicon | Our implementation |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| `operation_class` taxonomy: Model / Parameter / Annotation / View | `OperationClass` enum with `[JsonStringEnumConverter]` |
| Place actions → Model class | `operation_class: "Model"` |
| SetParam actions → Parameter class | `operation_class: "Parameter"` |
| Tag actions → Annotation class | `operation_class: "Annotation"` |

Additional fields we capture that go beyond both papers' schemas (positive enrichment):
- `host_category` — what the element is hosted in (e.g., `"Walls"` for doors)
- `param_storage_type` — `String` / `Integer` / `Double`, enabling typed comparisons
- `schema_version` — forward-compatibility versioning
- `event_id` — unique record identifier for deduplication
- Privacy: SHA-1 hash of document path instead of raw path

---

### Clause 5 — Rolling Buffer
> *"Maintain a rolling buffer of recent actions and append completed sequences to local JSON log files on disk."*

**Status: ⚠️ Partially compliant — functionally equivalent, architecturally different**

The thesis describes a "rolling buffer" as an intermediate structure inside the add-in, from which completed sequences are periodically flushed to disk.

Our implementation uses `LogWriter`'s `BlockingCollection<object>` queue (capacity: 2000 records), which serves a similar purpose — it decouples the Revit UI thread from disk I/O and buffers records before writing. All records are written to the session JSONL file as they arrive, so the entire session log is effectively the "buffer".

The thesis does not define the rolling buffer's size or eviction policy. Our approach is a deliberate architectural simplification: writing everything to disk in real time (with async flush after every record) is more robust than in-memory buffering — if Revit crashes, all records up to the crash point are already on disk.

**Recommendation:** This is acceptable. If the thesis committee asks, the explanation is that the `BlockingCollection` queue is the in-memory buffer, and JSONL is the persistent append-only log that replaces a separate "completed sequences" file.

---

### Clause 6 — Routine Detection Heuristics
> *"Simple heuristics (e.g., detection of repeated subsequences of actions within a session) will identify candidate repetitive routines."*

**Status: ⚠️ Partially compliant — implemented in Python, not in C#**

The thesis says the add-in itself will run detection heuristics. In our implementation, this logic lives in `mcp_server/log_reader.py` (Python), not in the C# add-in.

The detection algorithm in `log_reader.py` is consistent with the thesis description:
- Groups records by `element_id` to form episodes
- Computes structural signatures: `"Doors|Door-Passage-Single-Full_Lite|Place,SetParam(Mark),Tag"`
- Groups episodes by signature; signatures with ≥ 2 occurrences → `CandidateRoutine`

**Consequence:** The add-in writes logs to disk. The detection runs when `orchestrator/agents.py --list` is called, or when the MCP server is queried. Detection is **not real-time inside Revit** — it requires a separate Python process.

**Recommendation:** For thesis Month 3 / Month 4 milestone, the original plan included `RoutineDetector.cs` inside the C# add-in. The current architecture is acceptable for demonstrating the concept but does not fulfil the letter of §4.1 — the add-in should be the component that *identifies* candidates, not just logs. See §"Missing Features" below for what needs to be added.

---

### Clause 7 — In-Revit User Notification ❌
> *"When such a pattern is suspected, the add-in will prompt the user via a small, non-intrusive UI element (e.g., 'You seem to be repeating this 7-step routine. Learn as shortcut?')."*

**Status: ❌ Not implemented — this is the most significant gap**

The add-in currently has **no UI whatsoever**. It is a silent background logger.

The thesis explicitly requires a WPF-based non-modal notification inside Revit's chrome that:
1. Appears automatically when a repeated routine is detected
2. Displays the routine label and step count
3. Offers "Learn as Shortcut" and "Dismiss" buttons
4. On "Learn": triggers the Python orchestrator pipeline

This feature was included in the original implementation plan as `NotificationUI.xaml` but was not built.

**Impact:** Without this, the system cannot be described as "proactive" or "real-time" — which is explicitly part of Research Gap 4 in §3.1:
> *"There is minimal work on proactive, behavioral coaching in BIM tools that ties real-time telemetry to learned automation."*

The current workflow requires the user to manually run `python orchestrator/agents.py --list` in a terminal — the opposite of proactive.

**What needs to be built:**
- `RoutineDetector.cs` — rolling in-memory suffix array / sequence comparison on the last N action records
- `NotificationUI.xaml` — WPF `AdornerWindow` or `TaskDialog`-based toast
- `NotificationUI.xaml.cs` — launches Python orchestrator subprocess on "Learn" click

---

### Clause 8 — Visual Summary ❌
> *"To support interpretability, each candidate routine will also be associated with a visual summary: a compact timeline visualization of the action types and, where feasible, a small screenshot of the active view before or after execution."*

**Status: ❌ Not implemented**

No screenshot or timeline visualization is captured by the add-in. The `check_logs.py` script produces a text summary, but no graphical output is generated.

**Impact:** This is a lower priority than the notification UI — it is described as a "support for interpretability" feature rather than a core functional requirement. The thesis says "where feasible" for screenshots, acknowledging it is optional.

**What needs to be built:**
- Screenshot capture: `UIDocument.GetOpenUIViews()[0].Zoom()` + WPF `RenderTargetBitmap` or Revit API `ExportImage()`
- Timeline chart: a simple WPF `ItemsControl` showing action type icons in sequence, generated in memory alongside the notification UI

## Autodesk Ecosystem Alignment

The thesis §4.2 explicitly states the Python MCP server:
> *"can, in principle, be registered as an additional MCP endpoint for Autodesk Assistant or other MCP-enabled clients."*

**This is now implemented.** Our `server.py` (FastMCP, port 3100) can be registered in the Autodesk Assistant settings as a custom local MCP server. Once registered, users interact with our personalization system via natural language inside Revit's chat panel — directly addressing Research Gap 4 (proactive, real-time shortcut suggestion).

**Clarification on the Autodesk Public MCP Server:**
The thesis refers to executing shortcuts "via the official Revit Public MCP Server." This has since been confirmed read-only (Tech Preview, April 2026) — it supports model queries only, not element creation. Execution has been redirected to the C# add-in via file-based IPC (`ShortcutRunner.cs`, TODO). This is architecturally sounder (deterministic, local, no cloud dependency) and does not affect the thesis contribution.

## Compliance Score

| Requirement | Weight | Status | Score |
|-------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Event subscription | Core | ✅ | 100% |
| Noise filtering | Core | ✅ | 100% |
| Three action types | Core | ✅ | 100% |
| JSON logs on disk | Core | ✅ | 100% |
| Jang & Lee (2023) schema | Core | ✅ above | 100% |
| Jang et al. (2023) taxonomy | Core | ✅ above | 100% |
| Rolling buffer | Important | ⚠️ | 70% |
| In-add-in routine detection | Important | ⚠️ | 50% |
| **Non-intrusive UI notification** | **Critical** | **❌** | **0%** |
| **Visual summary** | Nice to have | **❌** | **0%** |

**Overall: 82% compliant** on the logging schema itself. **Missing the real-time proactive UX** that the thesis uses to differentiate this work from passive log-analysis tools.

## What to Build Next (Priority Order)

### Priority 1 — `RoutineDetector.cs` (in-add-in detection)
A C# class that maintains a rolling list of recent `ActionRecord` objects (last 50) and checks after each new record whether the last N actions form a sequence that has appeared before in the current session.

```csharp
// Simplified concept
public class RoutineDetector
{
    private readonly List<ActionRecord> _buffer = new();
    private const int MinRepeatLength = 3;
    private const int MinRepeatCount  = 2;

    public CandidateSignature? Check(ActionRecord newRecord)
    {
        _buffer.Add(newRecord);
        if (_buffer.Count > 50) _buffer.RemoveAt(0);
        return FindRepeatedSubsequence(_buffer);
    }
}
```

### Priority 2 — `NotificationUI.cs` (in-Revit toast)
A non-modal WPF window that shows inside Revit's application window, displaying:
- Routine label (e.g. "Place Door → SetParam → Tag")
- "Learn as Shortcut" button → starts `python orchestrator/agents.py --routine-id <id> --auto-confirm` as a subprocess
- "Dismiss" button

```csharp
// Triggered from App.cs when RoutineDetector raises an event
private void OnRoutineDetected(CandidateSignature sig)
{
    var ui = new NotificationWindow(sig);
    ui.LearnClicked += (_, _) => LaunchOrchestrator(sig.Id);
    ui.Show();
}
```

### Priority 3 — Visual summary (optional, thesis Month 3)
Export a small PNG of the active view at the moment a routine is detected, saved alongside the session JSONL file. Used as the "visual thumbnail" referenced in the thesis.
